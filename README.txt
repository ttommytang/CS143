This repository contains the projects for CS143 taken in Fall 2015 at UCLA. Project 1 is primarily in HTML, PHP, and MySQL and project 2 is primarily in C++.

1A: Simple PHP calculator app

1B: Web query interface for a given database

1C: Movie database website (i.e. IMDB)
- Built a web interface with 8 dynamic web pages with access to a relational movie database system, where users could do searching with multiple keywords with filtering and adding/editing comments on certain movies.
- Used PHP to access MySQL and the Apache Web-database service, and built the back-end relational schema with MySQL scripts.
- Retouched the web interface with bootstrap to make it more user-friendly, offered functions like filtering for customized searching.

2: Implement B+Tree index on Bruinbase
- Implemented multiple classes and APIs of a practical SQL engine using C++ based on a given skeleton
- Optimized the query handling efficiency by creating a B+ tree index for the database, and gave tests to the engine program to achieve faster query operation
